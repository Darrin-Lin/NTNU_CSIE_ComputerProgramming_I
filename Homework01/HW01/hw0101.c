One day as he was meditating on \
the Architecture, \033[0;34mLinus\033[0m fell into a trance and was granted a vision. And in the \
vision he saw a great Penguin, serene and well-favoured, sitting upon an ice floe \
eating fish. And at the sight of the Penguin \033[0;34mLinus\033[0m was deeply afraid, and he cried \
unto the spirits of \033[0;34mTuring\033[0m, \033[0;34mvon Neumann\033[0m and \033[0;34mMoore\033[0m for \
an interpretation of the dream.\n\n");

beloved hacker. You are exceedingly \
cool and froody. The great Penguin which you see is an Operating System which you \
shall create and deploy unto the earth. The ice-floe is the earth and all the \
systems thereof, upon which the Penguin shall rest and rejoice at the completion \
of its task. And the fish on which the Penguin feeds are the crufty Licensed \
codebases which swim beneath all the earthâ€™s systems. The Penguin shall hunt and \
devour all that is crufty, gnarly and bogacious; all code which wriggles like \
spaghetti, or is infested with blighting creatures, or is bound by grave and \
perilous Licences shall it capture. And in capturing shall it replicate, and in \
replicating shall it document, and in documentation shall it bring freedom, serenity \
and most cool froodiness to the earth and all who code therein.\"\033[0m\n\n");

the World Wide Web for all to take and behold. And in the fulness of Internet Time the Kernel grew \
and replicated, becoming most cool and exceedingly froody, until at last it was recognised as \
indeed a great and mighty Penguin, whose name was Tux. And the followers of \033[0;34mLinus\033[0m took \
refuge in the Kernel, the Libraries and the Utilities; they installed Distribution after Distribution, and \
made sacrifice unto the GNU and the Penguin, and gave thanks to the spirits \
